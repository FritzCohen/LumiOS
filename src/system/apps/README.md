# Apps Explained

Apps are created as JSX code, and each app has a unique name thats mapped in the components

When creating an app make sure it follows the executable format,
which is done to give some information about how to display it correctly.

import { useGetNeededApp } from "... /constants/betterGetNeededApp"

Don't use the other one, this one correctly gets the app depending on what format it is
like file/folder/exe/etc
