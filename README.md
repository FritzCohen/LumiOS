## Contributing
This respository will become open source shortly.
Games have been moved to a seperate repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/LuminesenceProject/lumi-games).
When adding games, please make sure to include an image.

Sometimes features suggeseted will not be added.
This includes most things that have to involve an outside server, since it will ruin the functionality of being able to download
Lumi OS and use it anywhere.

You will be marked as **contributer** in this repository. 

## Issues

To report a problem, open the [issues](https://github.com/LuminesenceProject/LumiOS/issues) on the github page, and click 'New issue'

If you are facing a white screen, this is a common error.

### Built in solution
The easy solution is to simply type "lumiplus" in that exact order, and it will wipe all data stored.
This only works in v4.2 and above of lumi os.

Please try to provide a screenshot of the problem, or any error messege.

## Todo

- Release source code
- Remove redundant features
- Release new websites for accessing Lumi OS
- Add more games?
